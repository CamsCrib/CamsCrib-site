    <p> I've learned to create simple circuit boards with the BOJACK Electronics Fun Kit I've bought from Amazon.</p>

  <div class="SimpleLED">
    <h2>Simple LED</h2>
    <p class="Pa"> I connected a jumper wires to the positive and negative terminals on each opposite side. Then, I connected the positive end from the jumper wire to a resistor which is connected with the positive end of the LED. After that, I connected the negatively charged jumper wire to the negative end of the LED. Finally, the multiple LEDs turned on.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="LightDependent">
    <h2>Light Dependent</h2>
    <p class="Pa">The setup for the Light Dependent LED is about the same, but this time the light sensor has to be attahced with the resistor. As you can assume in the name, the LED is dependent on light.
Examples of this in tech can be when smartphones react to the levels of light in the surrounding area to adjust brightness on the phone.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="TouchSensor">
    <h2>Touch Sensor</h2>
    <p class="Pa"> This build requires a transistor. Negative terminal connected to the Collector side of the transistor. The resistor is connected to the Emmiter side of the transistor. The resistor is connected to the negative side of the LED. The positive side of the LED is connected to jumper wire that connects to the positive terminal. Connect a wire to the base of the transistor and a wire to the positive side of the LED. The LED will turn on when the wires are touched. An example of this can be smartphones again actually. Phones screens are touch sensitive which allows access to apps and other things on the phone. </p>
  </div>

  <div class="ButtonLED1">
    <h2>Button LED 1</h2>
    <p class="Pa"> This button LED requires a button. Pretty much setup the same as the simple LED, which is why the LED is on. If you incoporate a button connected to positive and negative, and connect the same negative end to the LED, pusing the button will turn it off.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="ButtonLED2">
    <h2>Button LED 2</h2>
    <p class="Pa"> This button LED requires a button.This one is a bit different. The button is actually behind the resistor this time. The button switch is off meaning the light is stying off even with the power on. One you press the button the light turns on.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="ButtonLED3">
    <h2>Button LED 3</h2>
    <p class="Pa"> I pretty much setup the same as the last LED. This time I just held the button which made the light get brighter th longer it was held. </p>

  <h2>Mini Coding Assignments</h2>
  
    <p> I've tried to create a body fat calculator and learned how to use basic html and css.
      <br>
    Worked in a group of three to create a test safety weather website for JSU.
