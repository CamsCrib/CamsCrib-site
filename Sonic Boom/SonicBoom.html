    <h2>Band Camp</h2>
    <p style="text-indent: 25px;"> Coming into band camp for the first time as a freshmen felt like a fever dream almost. Transferring all the way from Texas to Mississippi was rough considering how far apart the two states are. First you are exploring the campus as an incoming JSU student then next you are just sweating and breathing hard because of just the almost never ending early mornings of physical training. The basic requirements for camp was to be ready by report time at 4:00AM, have a white tee and navy blue shorts on, preferably white shoes, and ABSOLUTLEY no jewlrey at any time. Knowing myself, I've made a fewwwwwww mistakes that in return I recieved consequences. It felt like it would never end especially being far from home. Not knowing too much what an HBCU band was, I was pretty much walking in the dark.  </p>

    <h2>Band Camp FINAL PART</h2>
    <p style="text-indent: 25px;"> The first season had me working! During band camp, we still had to wear masks because Covid-19 was more prevelant then it is today. We had to play a musical piece (anything really) and introduce ourselves to the rest of the freshmen class and band staff. Seeing all of my soon to be band siblings talk about their audition pieces and how ready they were really did have me nervous ngl....but I sort of figured it out in the end?? When the moment came to play one I was a little scared because I juse went over the audition I had played for the band and I was like, "aww dangg". It was basically up to my memory to get my part in the section. I was struggling to put on my mask while everyone else was going down the row to audition. I hated those stringed mask, I don't know why we couldn't use the regular ones with that had the strings that just sat on your ears with band symbol on them. I got ready to stand up with my mask half on and Doc was like, "You are NOT able to play unto your mask is on your face." It kinda saved me but was it really worth it though? When I finally had it on everyone else got their parts and was talking but I still had to play mines so I did, it went okay. But it wasn't enough to at least put me on second part. The section leader at the time didn't really even acknowledge my piece and just put me on third. Wow that sucked didn't it? I was salty for a bit ngl but I grew to love my part and improved in my own ways on the horn.    </p>
